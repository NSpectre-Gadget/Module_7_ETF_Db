## ETF PERFORMANCE

In this project, we used SQL and Python together to analyze data and to build financial applications that use real databases.  After learning that database tables are too large to transfer across networks. We appplied database techniques to acquire data from a database that oftentimes resides in the cloud.  This method allows us to optimize cloud computing and free up memory space on our computer.  This is a great example of displaying the usefulness of learning and working with SQL.

## TECHNOLOGIES
While working with SQL and Python together to analyze data and to build financial applications that use real databases, we imported the following tools:

SQLAlchemy -  The Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.

Voilà -  It is a library which is used to directly convert your Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) into stand-alone interactive web-based dashboard applications.

It is part of the Jupyter ecosystem of open-source projects. Voilà turns Jupyter notebooks into standalone web applications.
